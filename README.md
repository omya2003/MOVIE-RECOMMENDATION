The primary objective of this project is to address the challenge of sifting through an extensive library of movies to find the perfect one. Users often face the dilemma of selecting a movie that aligns with their interests, leading to decision fatigue. My recommendation system is designed to simplify this process by offering tailored movie suggestions based on user preferences and reviews.

To achieve this, I have integrated several key elements:

Data Collection: Gathering movie-related data, including titles, genres, actors, directors, user ratings, and reviews.
NLP Model: Utilizing Natural Language Processing to analyze movie reviews and determine sentiment.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommending movies based on their attributes, such as genres and actors.
Collaborative Filtering: Offering recommendations by understanding user preferences and movie similarities.
Our system empowers users to explore a vast cinematic universe and discover hidden gems that resonate with their unique tastes.
